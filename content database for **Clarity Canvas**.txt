### How the themes map to your workshop material  

* **Self‑Doubt** reframes doubt as possibility awareness.
* **Internal Authority** arises from the dialogue about conditioned rules versus inner guidance.
* **Frustration** is recast as a pivot signal rather than failure.
* **Core Values** leverage the Past‑Present‑Future “Values Roundtable” prompt.
* **Internal Voices** draw on the Dreamer / Pragmatist / Team‑Leader exercise.
* **Change & Adaptation** comes from the Day 20 dialogue between parts that resist and welcome change.

Feel free to add or refine themes later—the schema is ready for immediate ingestion by Clarity Canvas.
